# Garlic Directory (WIP)
A directory of users.
This is my first real project with React so I'm sorry if it's kinda crap.

## Setup
For both web and server, make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.  

### Web 
Run `yarn` to install all the required dependencies.  
Run `yarn start` to launch the test server on `localhost:3000`. You can now start editing the code in `./src`.

### Cloud/Server
Run `yarn` to install all the required dependencies.
Run `yarn start` to launch the server, this will run in a cloud function, so it's not necessary.
